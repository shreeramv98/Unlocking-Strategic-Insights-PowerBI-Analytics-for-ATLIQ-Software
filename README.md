Company’s background:

AltiQ Hardware is a firm that has expanded significantly in recent years and has operations all over the world. This business offers computers and computer accessories through three different channels.

Direct Distributors to Retailers
Based on surveys, gut instinct, and some excel analysis, the firm recently suffered an unanticipated loss from opening a shop in America. Additionally, the company's rivals have a small number of analytics teams that can do analysis and make data-driven decisions. As a result, the AltiQ hardware has no choice but to create its analytics team in order to make data-driven insights and judgments in the future and thrive in the market.

Project kick-off meeting, where you should understand why this project is being undertaken and any other questions.

Importing data into PowerBi:

We must provide the Database access credential to import the datasets from the MySQL database to PowerBi because that is the project's chosen database.

Project Result:

Using this report, data-based judgments may be made. Additionally, based on the circumstances, it will assist in addressing a variety of why questions.
